**What is PICA?**

PICA is an implementation guide that details how the *conformance* of processes conducted in a medical setting can be validated compared to an existing guideline or process description. It does so by providing guidance on how to do correct logging via the FHIR速 AuditEvent resource. The IG also provides guidance on how to conduct performance auditing based on this log with tools from the process mining domain, and including this in existing software architectures.

**What isn't PICA?**

PICA does **not** deal with mining processes, or enriching existing audit logs.

## Architecture

PICA can be applied to any FHIR速 based audit logging. It is aligned with concepts from the [IHE RESTful Audit Trail and Node Authentication (RATNA)](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_RESTful-ATNA.pdf) profile.

To be applicable as an addition in existing infrastructures, it is recommended to implement PICA as an *Event Repository*. An example for this, specific to the radiology domain, is outlined in [IHE Standardized Operational Log of Events (SOLE)](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/Radiology/IHE_RAD_Suppl_SOLE.pdf) profile. 

The PICA Project hosts a reference implementation of the *Event Repository* in [TODO](aist.science). This is a [HAPI](https://hapifhir.io/) based FHIR速 server, supporting all profiles, extensions, and FHIR速 Operations this IG has to offer.

## Process Mining Views

The following table shows the possible options PICA can be applied for conformance purposes. Based on the **core**, which is required at all times in a patient centric view, each view can be applied individually or joined with each other.

| View | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Outcome                                                                               |
